# KeyText
This Python application can identify synonymous or similar words that can be labeled as a single idea in a dataset using the word2vec package. It can track the appearance of these words over time and compare the frequency of two or three sets of words (ideas).
You can cite the application by coppying this bibtext:
```

    address = {Jakarta},
    title = {{KeyText}},
    type = {Computer software},
    url = {https://github.com/ikbaloss/KeyText},
    author = {Maulana, Ikbal},
    year = {2025},
    institution = {National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN)},
}
```
